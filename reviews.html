            <p>The most important thing to keep in mind with this hobby is that everything comes down to preference, the
                following reviews and information provided is based on my personal experiences and will be objectively
                influenced by my preferences. Also, keep in mind preferences change over time and especially after
                trying new
                things.</p>

                <h3>Cannon Keys - Bakeneko 60</h3>
                <div class="paragraph">
                    <p>Having not used a 60% board for a few years, it took a bit of adjusting to but I have come to
                        enjoy the size a lot more than I initially expected. The Bakeneko60 is a gummy o-ring mount
                        style keyboard which makes for a nice isolated sound. My only complaint would be that the board
                        can sound a bit hollow without any mods, but this is easily fixed with some sound dampening
                        material. My only note on trying sound dampening with this board is the material has to be
                        pretty thin or else the bounce provided by the o-ring is lost. For my setup, I did the classic
                        tape mod as well as diy two part silicone. This was my first attempt at custom silicone but I
                        think it turned out pretty good, just had to be careful about how much I put in
                        the case so as to not completely remove the benefits of the gummy o-ring isolation.</p>
                </div>
                <ul>
                    <h3>Pros -</h3>
                    <li>soft typing feel</li>
                    <li>isolated acoustics</li>
                    <li>included stabilizers</li>
                    <li>price</li>
                    <h3>cons -</h3>
                    <li>hollow sound when stock</li>
                    <li>switches pop out easily at the corners</li>
                    <li>need to fix backspace in via</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="paragraph">
                    <p>I would describe the typing experience of this board to be similar to a top mount in terms of
                        stiffness but with the benefits of being isolated. After using keyboards with flex cuts, half
                        plates, or
                        gaskets, this is not as gummy as the mount style naming would make you think. A fun quirk about
                        the flex
                        with this board is when you press on one corner the opposite comes up out of the case slightly.
                        The simplicity of the design is something worth appreciating and makes assembling quite easy
                        especially with hotswap sockets. The only issue with hotswap on a o-ring keyboard is that since
                        the switches are what keeps the whole assembly together (that plus the o-ring pushing
                        up against the corner switches) it is not uncommon for switches to pop out when trying to put
                        the
                        board together meaning the process has to be redone.

                    <p>As an entry level board I think this is a pretty good deal, you get a lot for the money. I think
                        the bakeneko is also a great chance to try a gummy o-ring board without a huge investment. I
                        would recommend this board to someone who is looking for a budget friendly 60% keyboard as an
                        entry point into the hobby. However if you already have experience with other enthusiast boards
                        I would skip this and look for something that could be considered an "upgrade" unless you really
                        need to try a gummy o-ring keyboard.</p>
