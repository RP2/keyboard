        <h2>A little backstory...</h2>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>I started my keyboard journey like a lot of people, playing PC games. I used to be a console only player
                as a kid but as I got older and needed to do school work on a computer, it was only natural that I start
                picking up on PC gaming. My first board was a Razer mechanical keyboard with the green clicky switches
                and from there it's only been down hill. At the time I was not aware of an enthusiast community, only
                mass production prebuilt "gamer" keyboards. At the time I was happy and enjoyed trying out new boards
                every few years until I stubbled upon "custom" keyboards.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Today and the future!</h2>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>With my years of experience and experimenting with many different products, I can confidently say that
                prebuilt keyboards from companies like Logitech, Razer, and Corsair aren't worth the price. I
                unfortunately had to learn this the hard way, but with the keyboard enthusiast community growing and the
                demand for increasingly higher quality products growing, I believe that it's easier than ever to get into
                custom keyboards. Though I say it is "easier" now than ever before, there are so many choices,
                variables, and preferences that it can easily be overwhelming, I find myself lost in all the options
                from time to time. With that in mind, my goal is to offer my experiences to those who are looking for a
                streamlined experiences. If you would like me to build you a keyboard, please refer to the contact section.</p>
