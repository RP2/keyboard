        <h2>A little backstory...</h2>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>I started my keyboard journey like a lot of people, playing PC games. I used to be a console only player
                as a kid but as I got older and needed to do school work on a computer, it was only natural that I start
                picking up on PC gaming. My first board was a Razer mechanical keyboard with the green clicky switches
                and from there it's only been down hill. At the time I was not aware of an enthusiast community, only
                mass production prebuilt "gamer" keyboards. At the time I was happy and enjoyed trying out new boards
                every few years until I stubbled upon "custom" keyboards.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Today and the future!</h2>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>With my years of experience and experimenting with many different products, I can confidently say that
                prebuilt keyboards from companies like Logitech, Razer, and Corsair aren't worth the price. I
                unfortunately had to learn this the hard way, but with the keyboard enthusiast community growing and the
                demand for increasingly higher quality products growing, I believe that its easier than ever to get into
                custom keyboards. Though I say it is "easier" now than ever before, there are so many choices,
                variables, and preferences that it can easily be overwhelming, I find myself lost in all the options
                from time to time. With that in mind, my goal is to help new comers along with those who have been
                around the block and to provide a resource they can turn to. My objective is to share my experience as
                well as offer my time to commission keyboard builds if one is interested. If you would like me to build
                a keyboard for you please refer to the contact section.</p>
